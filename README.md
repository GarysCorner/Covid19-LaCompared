## Description
This is a simple project aimed at visualizing and comparing Covid-19 data from Louisiana, a state which is very important to us (people from Louisiana).  The main analysis/visualization is in the file CovidData.py, which pulls data from one or more submodules or locations.

## Datasets

* **[nytimes/covid-19-data](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data)** - Data on new cases and new deaths in the US and Louisiana were taken from this dataset.
* **[Data on Covid-19 from Our World in Data](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data)**
* **[U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov)** - Population of the US and of Louisiana were taken from the Census Bureau and used for per capita comparisons.
* **[Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth)** - World population

## Limitation
The analysis here is done with data from outside sources, which themselves are compiling data from other sources, which themselves...  Some of these sources have changed for the US, and there are reasons to believe that some of them may have issues with reliability, and so the analysis here can only be as good as the underlying data which is...questionable.  

*Of note the data related to new cases and new deaths took on a weekly pattern after the CDC lost control of the data which is reason to be suspicious*

Please excuse spelling, I hammered this out pretty quick, and if you are reading this it means I didn't follow through on circling back to fix it :(

## Liabilities
This project should be interesting and nothing more, it is not intended for research purposed or policy decisions.  No decisions, assumptions, accusations, etc stemming from the analysis here should be made, and anyone who does so will do so at their own risk.  Any liability resulting from the use of this analysis is solely the end user's responsibility. 

### Liabilities TLDR
It's all on you bro, don't use this and then come blame me.
