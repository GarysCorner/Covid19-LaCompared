# Covid-19 Louisiana Data Compared

**This project is a replacement for the garyscorner for of nytimes/covid-19-data which will no longer be updated**

## Description
This is a simple project aimed at visualizing and comparing Covid-19 data from Louisiana, a state which is very important to us (people from Louisiana).  The main analysis/visualization are in the file CovidData.py, which pulls data from one or more submodiles or locations.

## Datasets

* **[nytimes/covid-19-data](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data)** - Data on new cases and new deaths in the US and Louisiana were taken from this dataset.

## Limitation
The analysis here is done with data from outside sources, which themselves are compiling data from other sources, which themselves...  Some of these sources have changed for the US, and there are reasons to believe that some of them may have issues with reliability, and so the analysis here can only be as good as the underlying data which is...questionable.  

*Of note the data related to new cases and new deaths took on a weekly pattern after the CDC lost control of the data which is reason to be suspicious*

## Liabilities
This project should be intesting and nothing more, it is not intended for research purposed, or policy decisions.  No decisions, assumptions, accusations, etc steming from the analysis here should be made, and anyone who does so will do so at their own risk.  Any liability resulting from the use of this analysis is solly the end users responsibility. 

### Liabilities TLDR
Its all on you bro, dont use this and then come blaim me.
